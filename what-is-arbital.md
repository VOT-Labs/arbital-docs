# What is Arbital?

Arbital lets you run automated market making strategies on perp DEXes to generate trading volume and farm points - without needing to actively trade.

### The Problem

Market making is one of the most profitable and consistent trading strategies in crypto - but historically:

* It required quant teams,
* Low-latency infrastructure,
* Deep understanding of inventory risk,
* And privileged access to exchanges.

Retail users were locked out.

### The Arbital Solution

Arbital abstracts all of that complexity into simple, configurable bots that:

* Continuously place buy & sell orders,
* Earn maker rebates + spread,
* Manage inventory risk automatically,
* And help users farm points and incentives on perp DEXes.

Think of Arbital as: **"Decentralized Wintermute - accessible to everyone."**

**You choose:**

* The exchange
* The asset
* The risk profile

**Arbital handles:**

* Order placement
* Inventory management
* Risk controls
* Execution logic
