## Core Strategy: TWAP Market Making

Arbital's core strategy is a TWAP-based passive market maker.

TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) means orders are placed gradually over time, rather than all at once. \
\
But unlike traditional TWAP (used for execution), Arbital's TWAP is designed for market making, not directional trading.

## What the Bot Actually Does

At all times, the bot:

* Places limit buy orders slightly below market price
* Places limit sell orders slightly above market price
* Refreshes these orders every few seconds

So it:

* Buys low
* Sells high
* Repeats this many times

This creates:

* Trading volume
* Spread capture

## Why Use Arbital?

Arbital allows anyone to act as a retail market maker, providing liquidity that tightens spreads and deepens order books across both DEXs and CEXs.

By deploying capital through Arbital:

* Exchanges benefit from tighter pricing and higher liquidity
* Traders receive better execution
* Market makers generate sustained trading volume

In return, Arbital users earn rewards through exchange incentive programs and airdrops tied to liquidity provision.

## Incentive Opportunities

Professional market makers have historically captured a significant share of ecosystem incentive programs on exchanges such as Hyperliquid, Lighter, and Aster.

These opportunities were previously limited to top-tier firms with specialized infrastructure. Arbital now makes market making and participation in ecosystem incentive programs accessible to everyone.
