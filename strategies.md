# What Kind of Strategies Does Arbital Run?

## Core Strategy: TWAP Market Making

Arbital's core strategy is a TWAP-based passive market maker.

TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) means orders are placed gradually over time, rather than all at once. But unlike traditional TWAP (used for execution), Arbital's TWAP is designed for market making, not directional trading.

## What the Bot Actually Does

At all times, the bot:

* Places limit buy orders slightly below market price
* Places limit sell orders slightly above market price
* Refreshes these orders every few seconds

So it:

* Buys low
* Sells high
* Repeats this many times

This creates:

* Trading volume
* Spread capture
* Maker fee rebates

## Why Use Arbital?

Arbital allows anyone to act as a retail market maker, providing liquidity that tightens spreads and deepens order books across both DEXs and CEXs.

By deploying capital through Arbital:

* Exchanges benefit from tighter pricing and higher liquidity
* Traders receive better execution
* Market makers generate sustained trading volume

In return, Arbital users earn rewards through exchange incentive programs and airdrops tied to liquidity provision.

## Incentive Opportunities

Professional market makers have historically earned six to eight figure rewards from ecosystem incentives such as $HYPE (Hyperliquid), $LIT (Lighter) and $ASTER (Aster).

While these opportunities were previously limited to top-tier firms, Arbital makes market making and its rewards accessible to everyone.
