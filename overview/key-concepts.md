# Key Concepts

Essential terminology for using Arbital effectively.

## Delta-Neutral

A trading strategy where the portfolio's total delta (directional exposure) equals zero. Price movements don't affect your P&L — you earn from other sources like funding rates and spreads.

## Perpetual Futures (Perps)

Derivative contracts with no expiration date. They track the price of an underlying asset and use funding rates to stay aligned with spot prices.

## Funding Rate

Periodic payments between long and short traders on perp exchanges. When funding is positive, longs pay shorts. When negative, shorts pay longs.

## Market Making

Providing liquidity by placing both buy and sell orders. Market makers earn the spread between bid and ask prices.

## Spread

The difference between the best bid (buy) and ask (sell) prices. Tighter spreads = more competitive market.

## Rebalancing

Adjusting positions to maintain target allocations or delta-neutrality. Arbital bots auto-rebalance based on your configured thresholds.

## Slippage

The difference between expected and actual execution price. Larger orders typically experience more slippage.

## Collateral

Assets deposited as margin for trading. Required to open and maintain positions on perp exchanges.
