# Why Use Arbital?

Arbital allows anyone to act as a retail market maker, providing liquidity that tightens spreads and deepens order books across both DEXs and CEXs.

By deploying capital through Arbital:

* Exchanges benefit from tighter pricing and higher liquidity
* Traders receive better execution
* Market makers (retail/institutions) generate sustained trading volume

In return, Arbital users earn rewards through exchange incentive programs and airdrops tied to liquidity provision.

### Incentive Opportunities

Professional market makers have historically captured a significant share of ecosystem incentive programs on exchanges such as Hyperliquid, Lighter, and Aster.

These opportunities were previously limited to top-tier firms with specialized infrastructure. Arbital now makes market making and participation in ecosystem incentive programs accessible to everyone.
