# Execution Modes

Arbital offers three execution modes, depending on how aggressive you want to be.

## Aggressive

* Fastest order refresh
* Orders closer to top of the book/mid price
* Higher volume generation in a short period of time

Aggressive mode will allow you to hit the target volume fastest, but is more prone to slippage and faster inventory accumulation during volatile conditions.

## Normal (Default)

* Balanced refresh
* Moderate spreads
* Stable inventory behavior

Normal mode offers the best balance between volume generation and execution quality, reducing slippage while maintaining consistent fills.

## Passive

* Slower refresh
* Wider spreads
* Lower fees, fewer fills

Passive mode prioritizes execution quality and fee efficiency over speed, resulting in lower volume but reduced slippage and inventory churn.
