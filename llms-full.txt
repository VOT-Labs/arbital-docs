# How It Works

Arbital automates market-making strategies across perpetual DEXs, helping you earn trading rewards while managing risk.

## Why Use Arbital?

### The Problem

Perpetual DEXs need active market makers to provide tight spreads and deep order books. Historically, only professional firms with sophisticated infrastructure could participate — leaving exchanges with thin liquidity and traders with poor execution.

### The Solution

Arbital democratizes market making. By automating delta-neutral strategies, Arbital creates a win-win-win:

- **Exchanges** benefit from tighter pricing and higher liquidity
- **Traders** receive better execution with deeper order books
- **Market makers (you)** generate sustained trading volume and earn rewards

No quant background required. Configure a bot, deploy, and let Arbital's engine handle the rest.

## Who Is Arbital For?

Arbital is built for users who:

- **Want passive exposure to market making** — Earn from providing liquidity without building your own trading infrastructure
- **Want to farm points on perp DEXes** — Capture exchange incentive programs ($HYPE, $LIT, $ASTER) that reward active market makers
- **Don't want to actively trade** — Set up a bot once and let it run 24/7 with automated risk management
- **Prefer systematic, rules-based strategies** — No discretionary trading decisions; your bot follows the configuration you set

If you're looking for a hands-off way to participate in DeFi liquidity provision, Arbital handles the complexity so you can focus on strategy.

## The Core Loop

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Connect Wallet] --> B[Bind Credentials]
    B --> C[Configure Bot]
    C --> D[Bot Executes]
    D --> E[Earn Rewards]
    E --> D
```

1. **Connect Wallet** — Link your EVM or Solana wallet
2. **Bind Credentials** — Securely link exchange API access via signature
3. **Configure Bot** — Choose strategy, bias, execution mode, and budget
4. **Bot Executes** — Continuously places orders based on your configuration
5. **Earn Rewards** — Collect trading fees, points, and exchange incentives

## Strategy Types

### TWAP Market Maker

**Time-Weighted Average Price** execution spreads your orders over time.

**How it works:**
- Splits your notional across buy and sell orders
- Adjusts order placement based on your bias setting
- Refreshes orders at intervals based on execution mode
- Auto-manages inventory to control exposure

**Best for:** Consistent execution, larger positions, stable markets

### Grid Market Maker

Places orders at fixed price intervals to profit from oscillation.

**How it works:**
- Creates a grid of buy orders below current price
- Creates a grid of sell orders above current price
- Profits when price oscillates between grid levels
- Stops when price hits boundary limits

**Best for:** Ranging markets, capturing small price movements

## Position Bias

Control your directional exposure:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Bias Scale
        A["-1.0<br/>Full Short"] --- B["-0.5"] --- C["0<br/>Neutral"] --- D["+0.5"] --- E["+1.0<br/>Full Long"]
    end
```

| Bias | Strategy | Market View |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **-1 (Short)** | Prioritizes selling | Bearish, expect price drop |
| **0 (Neutral)** | 50/50 buy/sell | No directional view |
| **+1 (Long)** | Prioritizes buying | Bullish, expect price rise |

{% hint style="info" %}
Bias affects **when** buys and sells happen — not **whether** they happen. The bot always places both buy and sell orders. Total volume converges over the full run. Margin requirements increase by up to 20% at higher bias levels.
{% endhint %}

## Bot Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle: Create Bot
    Idle --> Pending: Start
    Pending --> Running: Connected
    Pending --> Failed: Error
    Running --> Stopping: Stop
    Running --> Completed: Target Reached
    Running --> Failed: Error
    Stopping --> Stopped: Done
    Stopped --> Pending: Restart
    Failed --> Pending: Retry
```

| State | Description | Actions Available |

| **Pending** | Connecting to exchange | Wait |
| **Running** | Actively trading | Stop |
| **Stopping** | Canceling orders, closing | Wait |
| **Stopped** | Manually stopped | Start, Edit, Delete |

| **Failed** | Error occurred | Restart, Edit, Delete |

## Architecture Overview

Arbital is built on a modern, scalable stack designed for high-frequency trading operations.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Client["👤 Client Layer"]
        U[User Browser]
    end

    subgraph Frontend["🌐 Frontend · Vercel"]

    API <--> BOT
    BOT --> B2 & B3

    B3 <-->|WebSocket| E3
```

### Component Breakdown

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 15, React 18 | User dashboard, bot management UI |
| **Backend** | NestJS 11 | API, authentication, bot orchestration |
| **Bot Engine** | Rust, Tokio | High-performance order execution |
| **Data** | ClickHouse, Redis | Analytics storage, session caching |
| **Infrastructure** | Vercel, K8s, DigitalOcean | Scalable cloud deployment |

### Data Flow

1. **User Actions** → Frontend sends requests to Backend API
2. **Bot Commands** → Backend orchestrates bot lifecycle via K8s
3. **Trade Execution** → Rust bots maintain WebSocket connections to exchanges
4. **Metrics** → Trading data streams to ClickHouse for analytics
5. **Real-time Updates** → Dashboard polls API for live bot status

## Non-Custodial Model

Arbital never holds your funds:

- **Your keys, your funds** — Assets stay in your exchange account
- **Credential binding** — API access linked via wallet signature, not stored keys
- **No withdrawal access** — Trading permissions only
- **Revoke anytime** — Unbind credentials from the dashboard

## Execution Modes

Control how responsive your bot is:

| Mode | Refresh Rate | Trade-off |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **Aggressive** | Every 3 seconds | Maximum volume, higher slippage risk |
| **Normal** | Every 5 seconds | Best balance of volume and execution quality |
| **Passive** | Every 7 seconds | Best execution quality, lower costs |

- **Aggressive** is more prone to slippage and faster inventory accumulation during volatile conditions
- **Normal** offers the best balance between volume generation and execution quality — **recommended for most users**
- **Passive** prioritizes execution quality and fee efficiency over speed

## Incentive Opportunities

Perpetual DEXs actively reward market makers who contribute liquidity. Professional firms have historically earned six to eight figure rewards from these programs — Arbital gives you access to the same opportunity.

**Active incentive programs include:**

| Exchange | Incentive | Token |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Extended** | Points program + token rewards | $HYPE |
| **Pacifica** | Points farming program | $LIT |
| **Aster** | Early liquidity incentives | $ASTER |

Incentive structures vary by exchange and season. Check the [Exchanges Overview](../exchanges/overview.md) for current program details.

## Inventory Management

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Track Delta] --> B{At Max<br/>Inventory?}
    B -->|No| C[Normal Trading<br/>Buy & Sell]
    B -->|Yes| D[Reduce Only<br/>Close Positions]
    C --> A
    D --> A
```

The bot automatically manages your position exposure:

1. **Tracks position delta** — Monitors buys vs. sells in USD
2. **Skews orders** — Adjusts bid/ask to naturally reduce inventory
3. **Enforces limits** — Stops adding to positions at max inventory
4. **Reduce-only mode** — Only closes positions when limits exceeded

This keeps your exposure controlled without manual intervention.

-->

## Delta-Neutral

A trading strategy where the portfolio's total delta (directional exposure) equals zero. Price movements don't affect your P&L — you earn from other sources like funding rates and spreads.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Portfolio["Delta-Neutral Portfolio"]
        direction LR
        L["🟢 Long Position<br/>+$1,000"]
        S["🔴 Short Position<br/>-$1,000"]
    end

    subgraph Result["Net Exposure"]
        D["Delta = $0<br/>Market Neutral"]
    end

    subgraph Profit["Profit Sources"]
        F[Funding Rates]
        SP[Bid-Ask Spread]
        R[Exchange Rewards]
    end

    L --> D
    S --> D
    D --> Profit

    style L fill:#22c55e,color:#fff
    style S fill:#ef4444,color:#fff
    style D fill:#3b82f6,color:#fff
```

**Key Benefit:** Whether the market goes up or down, your portfolio value stays stable while you earn from trading activity.

## Perpetual Futures (Perps)

Derivative contracts with no expiration date. They track the price of an underlying asset and use funding rates to stay aligned with spot prices.

## Funding Rate

Periodic payments between long and short traders on perp exchanges. When funding is positive, longs pay shorts. When negative, shorts pay longs.

## Market Making

Providing liquidity by placing both buy and sell orders. Market makers earn the spread between bid and ask prices.

## Spread

The difference between the best bid (buy) and ask (sell) prices. Tighter spreads = more competitive market.

## Rebalancing

Adjusting positions to maintain target allocations or delta-neutrality. Arbital bots auto-rebalance based on your configured thresholds.

## Slippage

The difference between expected and actual execution price. Larger orders typically experience more slippage.

## Collateral

Assets deposited as margin for trading. Required to open and maintain positions on perp exchanges.

# Connect Wallet

Arbital uses wallet-based authentication — no email or password required.

## How Authentication Works

Arbital uses **non-custodial authentication**:

1. You connect your wallet
2. Sign a challenge message (not a transaction)
3. The signature proves you own the wallet
4. A session is created for your browser

**Security:** Your private keys never leave your wallet. No transactions are sent. No tokens are spent.

## Supported Wallets

### EVM Wallets (for Extended)

| Wallet | Type | Recommended |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **MetaMask** | Browser extension | <i class="fa-circle-check">:circle-check:</i> Most popular |
| **Rainbow** | Mobile + Extension | Great UX |
| **WalletConnect** | Mobile bridge | Any WC-compatible wallet |
| **Coinbase Wallet** | Browser + Mobile | Easy onboarding |
| **Rabby** | Browser extension | Multi-chain support |

### Solana Wallets (for Pacifica)

| Wallet | Type | Recommended |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Phantom** | Browser + Mobile | <i class="fa-circle-check">:circle-check:</i> Most popular |
| **Solflare** | Browser + Mobile | Feature-rich |
| **Backpack** | Browser extension | xNFT support |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Need detailed setup help?** See our wallet-specific guides:
- [MetaMask Setup Guide](wallets/metamask.md)
- [Phantom Setup Guide](wallets/phantom.md)
- [Ledger Hardware Wallet Guide](wallets/ledger.md)
{% endhint %}

## Connection Steps

### First Time Setup

1. **Visit** [arbital.xyz](https://arbital.xyz)
2. **Click** "Connect Wallet"
3. **Select** your wallet from the list
4. **Approve** the connection in your wallet popup
5. **Sign** the authentication message
   - This is a text message, not a transaction
   - No gas fees required
   - Message includes a timestamp for security
6. **Enter invite code** if prompted (beta access)
7. **Done** — you're now logged in

### EIP-712 Typed Data Signing

For EVM wallets, Arbital uses EIP-712 typed data signing:

```
Domain: arbital.xyz
Message: "Sign this message to authenticate with Arbital"
Timestamp: [current time]
Wallet: [your address]
```

This standard:
- Shows you exactly what you're signing
- Cannot be replayed (timestamp-bound)
- Is widely supported by all major wallets

### Solana Message Signing

For Solana wallets, you sign a simple text message:
- Message includes your wallet address
- Timestamp prevents replay attacks
- Standard Solana signing flow

## Managing Your Session

### Session Duration

- Sessions last until you disconnect or clear cookies
- Automatic refresh keeps you logged in
- Multiple browser tabs share the same session

### Switching Wallets

1. Click your wallet address in the navbar
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. Connect with a different wallet
4. Each wallet address has its own bots and history

### Security Tips

- **Lock your wallet** when not actively using Arbital
- **Review signatures** before approving
- **Never share** your seed phrase with anyone
- **Use hardware wallets** for large balances

## Exchange Credential Binding

After connecting your wallet, you'll bind exchange credentials:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant A as Arbital
    participant W as Wallet
    participant E as Exchange

    U->>A: Select Exchange
    A->>U: Request Credential Binding
    U->>W: Approve Signature
    W->>A: Signed Message
    A->>E: Register Trading Agent
    E->>A: Agent ID Confirmed
    A->>U: ✅ Credentials Bound

    Note over U,E: Your keys never leave your wallet
    Note over A,E: Trading permissions only (no withdrawals)
```

### For Pacifica (Solana)
1. Select Pacifica as your exchange
2. Approve referral (sign message)
3. Verify $20+ balance
4. Create credentials (sign message)
5. Agent bound to your wallet

### For Extended (EVM)
1. Select Extended as your exchange
2. Click "Create Credentials"
3. Sign the binding message
4. Verify $20+ balance
5. Credentials linked to your wallet

## Troubleshooting

### Wallet Not Connecting

1. **Unlock your wallet** — ensure it's not locked
2. **Check the popup** — it may be behind other windows
3. **Refresh the page** — and try again
4. **Try another browser** — some extensions conflict
5. **Disable other wallet extensions** — temporarily

### Signature Request Not Appearing

1. **Check your wallet** — popup may be minimized
2. **Click the wallet icon** — in your browser toolbar
3. **Refresh** — and reconnect

### Wrong Network Warning

- Arbital auto-detects the appropriate network
- Your wallet doesn't need to be on a specific chain
- The signature works on any network

### Already Connected But Shows Disconnected

1. **Clear cookies** for arbital.xyz
2. **Reconnect** your wallet
3. **Sign** the authentication message again

## Multiple Accounts

- Each wallet address = separate Arbital account
- Bots and settings don't transfer between wallets
- Switch wallets to access different accounts

# Create Your First Bot

Step-by-step guide to deploying your first Arbital trading bot.

## <i class="fa-video">:video:</i> Video Walkthrough

Watch a complete walkthrough of creating and deploying your first bot:

{% embed url="https://www.loom.com/share/009b1e3f75d14c38bcead32d1d3363da" %}

## Before You Begin

Ensure you have:
- [ ] Connected your wallet (EVM for Extended, Solana for Pacifica)
- [ ] Sufficient balance on the exchange (minimum $20)

## Bot Creation Wizard

The creation wizard is a single-page form with multiple sections. All sections are visible at once with a sticky summary card on the right.

### 1. Strategy Selection

Choose your directional bias:

| Strategy | Bias Value | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Short** | -1 | Bearish bias, aggressive early selling |
| **Neutral** | 0 | No directional bias, balanced buying/selling |
| **Long** | +1 | Bullish bias, aggressive early buying |

**Default:** Neutral (recommended for beginners)

### 2. Exchange & Wallet Connection

Select your exchange and connect the appropriate wallet:

| Exchange | Wallet Type | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Pacifica** | Solana (Phantom, etc.) | Requires referral approval + $20 minimum |
| **Extended** | EVM (MetaMask, etc.) | Credential binding + $20 minimum |

After wallet connection, your balance is automatically fetched and validated.

### 3. Exchange-Specific Requirements

Each exchange has additional setup steps:

**Pacifica (Solana):**
1. Sign message to approve Arbital referral
2. Balance validation ($20+ required)
3. Sign message to create credentials

**Extended:**
1. Sign message to create credentials
2. Balance validation ($20+ required)

### 4. Trading Asset Selection

Choose the market to trade:

**Available Assets:** BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, XRP, LINK, HYPE, AAVE, VIRTUAL, XPL, ASTER

All assets are available on all exchanges. Your bot name auto-generates as `{exchange}_{asset}` when both are selected.

### 5. Execution Mode

Control how aggressively your bot trades:

| Mode | Refresh Interval | Use Case |
|------|------------------|----------|
| **Aggressive** | 3 seconds | High-volatility markets, rapid position adjustment |
| **Normal** | 5 seconds | Standard operation, balanced approach |
| **Passive** | 7 seconds | Low-volatility markets, reduced costs |

**Default:** Aggressive

### 6. Budget & Volume

Configure your budget — the maximum amount (fees + PnL) you are willing to spend before the bot automatically stops.

- **Expected Budget (USD):** Max fees + PnL spend before the bot stops
  - Minimum: $0.01
  - Maximum: Your wallet balance
  - Default: 30% of wallet balance
  - **Recommended starting budget:** $500–$1,000

- **Min Expected Volume (USD):** Calculated from budget × burn rate
  - Updates automatically when budget changes

{% hint style="info" %}
**Budget ≠ capital allocation.** Budget is the maximum you're willing to spend on fees and absorb in PnL before the bot shuts down. Your actual trading capital (notional) is configured separately.
{% endhint %}

**Burn Rates by Exchange:**
| Exchange | Fee Range |
|----------|-----------|
| Pacifica | 0.015-0.025% |
| Extended | 0.01-0.02% |

### 7. Inventory Management (Optional)

Control position exposure:

**Normal Mode (Default):** Auto-manages to keep exposure balanced

**Advanced Mode:** Fine-tune for specific strategies
- **Maximum Position Size:** $100-$500 USD hard cap on directional exposure
- **Inventory Skew Factor:** 0-100% rebalancing aggressiveness
  - 0% = Lazy drift (minimal rebalancing)
  - 100% = Aggressive rebalance (frequent rebalancing)

### 8. Review & Deploy

The sticky summary card shows:
- Bot name
- Strategy (Short/Neutral/Long)
- Exchange & wallet address
- Trading asset
- Execution mode
- Expected budget & volume range

Click **Create Bot** to deploy. The bot automatically starts after creation.

## Bot States

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Idle** | Created but never started |
| **Pending** | Queued, connecting to exchange |

# MetaMask Setup Guide

Connect your MetaMask wallet to Arbital for trading on EVM-based exchanges (Extended/Hyperliquid).

## Prerequisites

- Chrome, Firefox, Brave, or Edge browser
- MetaMask extension installed

## Step 1: Install MetaMask

If you don't have MetaMask yet:

1. Visit [metamask.io](https://metamask.io/download/)
2. Click **Download** for your browser
3. Add the extension to your browser
4. Create a new wallet or import an existing one

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Security:** Never share your seed phrase. MetaMask will never ask for it. Store it offline in a secure location.
{% endhint %}

## Step 2: Fund Your Wallet

For trading on Arbital, you'll need funds on the exchange, not in MetaMask directly. However, MetaMask is used for:

- **Authentication** — Proving wallet ownership
- **Credential binding** — Linking your trading permissions

No ETH gas is required for Arbital operations (signing only).

## Step 3: Connect to Arbital

1. Visit [arbital.xyz](https://arbital.xyz)
2. Click **Connect Wallet**
3. Select **MetaMask** from the wallet list
4. MetaMask popup appears — click **Connect**
5. Sign the authentication message
   - This is a **text signature**, not a transaction
   - No gas fees
   - Message includes timestamp for security

## Step 4: Bind Exchange Credentials

### For Extended (Hyperliquid)

1. Select **Extended** as your exchange
2. Click **Create Credentials**
3. Sign the binding message
4. Ensure you have $20+ balance on Hyperliquid
5. Credentials linked

## Network Configuration

Arbital works across multiple networks. MetaMask doesn't need to be on a specific chain for signing — the authentication works universally.

**Supported networks for reference:**
- Ethereum Mainnet
- Arbitrum
- Other EVM chains

## Troubleshooting

### MetaMask Popup Not Appearing

1. Check if MetaMask icon shows a notification badge
2. Click the MetaMask extension icon manually
3. The pending request should appear

### "User Rejected" Error

- You clicked **Reject** in the MetaMask popup
- Try again and click **Sign** or **Connect**

### Wrong Account Connected

1. Click your wallet address in Arbital navbar
2. Click **Disconnect**
3. In MetaMask, click your account icon
4. Select the correct account
5. Reconnect to Arbital

### Multiple Wallet Extensions

If you have multiple wallet extensions (Rainbow, Coinbase, etc.):

1. Disable other extensions temporarily
2. Or click the MetaMask option specifically in Arbital

## Security Best Practices

- <i class="fa-circle-check">:circle-check:</i> **Lock MetaMask** when not in use
- <i class="fa-circle-check">:circle-check:</i> **Review all signature requests** before approving
- <i class="fa-circle-check">:circle-check:</i> **Verify the domain** is arbital.xyz

## Step 3: Connect to Arbital

1. Visit [arbital.xyz](https://arbital.xyz)
2. Click **Connect Wallet**
3. Select **Phantom** from the wallet list
4. Phantom popup appears — click **Connect**
5. Sign the authentication message
   - This is a **text signature**, not a transaction
   - Minimal SOL fee (often zero)
   - Message includes timestamp for security

## Step 4: Bind Pacifica Credentials

Pacifica requires additional steps compared to EVM exchanges:

### 1. Approve Referral

1. Select **Pacifica** as your exchange
2. Click **Approve Referral**
3. Sign the referral message in Phantom
4. Wait for confirmation

### 2. Verify Balance

- Ensure you have **$20+ USDC** on Pacifica
- Balance is automatically checked

### 3. Create Agent

1. Click **Create Credentials**
2. Sign the agent binding message
3. Your trading agent is now linked to your wallet

{% hint style="info" %}
**What's an Agent?** On Solana, Arbital creates a trading agent tied to your wallet. This agent executes trades on your behalf without needing your private keys.
{% endhint %}

## Network Configuration

Phantom automatically connects to Solana Mainnet. No manual network configuration needed.

**Verify you're on Mainnet:**
1. Open Phantom
2. Click the gear icon (Settings)

2. Click the Phantom extension icon manually
3. The pending request should appear

### "User Rejected" Error

- You clicked **Cancel** in the Phantom popup
- Try again and click **Approve** or **Confirm**

### Insufficient Balance Error

- Ensure you have $20+ USDC on Pacifica
- Check you have a small amount of SOL for fees
- Refresh the page and try again

### Agent Already Exists

If you previously created an agent:
- Your existing agent will be used
- No need to create a new one
- If issues persist, contact support

### Transaction Failed

Solana network congestion can cause failures:
1. Wait a few minutes
2. Try again
3. Check [Solana Status](https://status.solana.com) for network issues

# Ledger Hardware Wallet Guide

Use your Ledger hardware wallet with Arbital for enhanced security on larger balances.

## Why Use a Hardware Wallet?

- **Private keys never leave the device** — Even if your computer is compromised
- **Physical confirmation required** — Every signature must be approved on the device
- **Best for larger balances** — Recommended for portfolios over $1,000

{% hint style="info" %}
**How it works:** Arbital only requires message signatures (not transactions). Your Ledger signs these messages, proving you own the wallet without exposing private keys.
{% endhint %}

## Supported Ledger Devices

- Ledger Nano S / S Plus
- Ledger Nano X
- Ledger Stax

## Prerequisites

- Ledger device with firmware updated
- Ledger Live installed
- MetaMask (for EVM) or Phantom (for Solana) connected to Ledger

## <i class="fa-video">:video:</i> Video: Grid vs TWAP Strategy

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Coming Soon** — A side-by-side comparison video explaining when to use each strategy is being created.
{% endhint %}

<!-- Video embed placeholder - replace with YouTube/Loom when ready:
{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" %}
-->

## Strategy Types

Arbital supports two market-making strategies:

### TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)

Spreads orders over time to reduce market impact. Best for consistent execution.

**Use when:**
- You want steady, predictable execution
- Trading larger positions
- Market conditions are relatively stable

### Grid Market Maker

Places orders at fixed price intervals to profit from oscillation. Best for ranging markets.

**Use when:**
- Price is expected to oscillate within a range
- You want to capture small price movements
- Market is not trending strongly

### Strategy Comparison

    end

    TWAP --> TW
    Grid --> GW
```

| Aspect | TWAP | Grid |
|--------|------|------|
| **Order Placement** | Continuous, time-weighted | Fixed price intervals |
| **Best Market** | Any condition | Ranging/sideways |
| **Profit Source** | Spread + volume | Price oscillation |
| **Risk Profile** | Lower (auto-manages) | Higher (boundary stops) |
| **Capital Efficiency** | Moderate | High in range |

## Core Parameters

### Notional (TWAP)

The total USD value to trade, split between buy and sell orders (unless biased).

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Small ($100-500) | Lower risk, suitable for testing |
| Medium ($500-2000) | Balanced approach |
| Large ($2000+) | Higher volume, more reward potential |

### Budget

The maximum amount (fees + PnL) you are willing to spend before the bot automatically stops. This is not your trading capital — it's your loss threshold.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Small ($100-500) | Conservative, suitable for testing |
| Medium ($500-1,000) | **Recommended starting range** |
| Large ($1,000+) | For experienced users with higher risk tolerance |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Budget ≠ notional.** Notional is how much you trade per cycle. Budget is the total fees and PnL the bot can consume before it shuts down.
{% endhint %}

### Bias

Directional preference from -1 (full short) to +1 (full long).

| Bias | Value | Behavior |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Short** | -1.0 | 100% sell orders, profits from price drops |
| **Slight Short** | -0.5 | 75% sell, 25% buy |
| **Neutral** | 0 | 50% buy, 50% sell (delta-neutral) |
| **Slight Long** | +0.5 | 75% buy, 25% sell |
| **Long** | +1.0 | 100% buy orders, profits from price increases |

{% hint style="info" %}
**How Bias Actually Works**

Bias only affects **when** buys and sells happen — not **whether** they happen. The bot will always place both buy and sell orders regardless of bias setting. Over a full run, total buy and sell volume still converges.

Think of it as timing priority: a long bias means the bot prioritizes buying earlier and selling later, not that it only buys.
{% endhint %}

**Important Notes:**
- Margin requirements increase by up to 20% at higher bias levels (closer to -1 or +1)
- Higher bias means more directional exposure during the run, even though volume converges over time
- For delta-neutral farming, keep bias at **0**

## Execution Modes

Control how frequently your bot refreshes orders:

| Mode | Refresh Interval | Spread Offset | Max Skew Offset | Best For |
|------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Aggressive** | 3 seconds | 0.1 bps | 5 bps | High-volatility, rapid response |
| **Normal** | 5 seconds | 0.2 bps | 10 bps | Standard operation |
| **Passive** | 7 seconds | 0.4 bps | 15 bps | Low-volatility, cost savings |

**Risk characteristics:**
- **Aggressive** — Maximizes volume but is more prone to slippage and faster inventory accumulation during volatile conditions
- **Normal** — Best balance between volume generation and execution quality. **Recommended starting mode** for most users
- **Passive** — Prioritizes execution quality and fee efficiency over speed. Ideal for stable markets or cost-sensitive strategies

{% hint style="info" %}
**Recommendation:** Start with **Normal** mode to understand how your bot behaves, then adjust based on market conditions and your goals.
{% endhint %}

## Inventory Management

Control your position exposure to manage risk.

### Max Inventory (USD)

Hard limit on directional exposure. When reached:
- **At max long:** Bot only places sell orders
- **At max short:** Bot only places buy orders

| Setting | Range | Use Case |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Conservative | $100-500 | Lower risk, tighter control |
| Moderate | $500-2000 | Balanced approach |
| Aggressive | $2000+ | Higher exposure tolerance |

**Default:** $2,000 USD

### Inventory Skew Factor

How aggressively the bot rebalances when inventory builds up.

| Factor | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **0%** | No adjustment (50/50 buy/sell regardless of inventory) |
| **30%** | Lazy drift (Passive mode default) |
| **50%** | Moderate rebalancing (Normal mode default) |
| **70%** | Strong rebalancing (Aggressive mode default) |
| **100%** | Full adjustment (0% on one side at max inventory) |

# Grid Strategy Guide

A comprehensive guide to the Grid Market Maker strategy.

## What is Grid Trading?

Grid trading places buy and sell orders at preset price intervals, creating a "grid" of orders. When price oscillates within the grid, orders fill and you profit from the spread.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Grid["Grid Structure"]
        S3["SELL $2,050 (Level 3)"]
        S2["SELL $2,025 (Level 2)"]
        S1["SELL $2,000 (Level 1)"]
        CP[/"Current Price $1,975"/]
        B1["BUY $1,950 (Level 1)"]
        B2["BUY $1,925 (Level 2)"]
        B3["BUY $1,900 (Level 3)"]
    end

    S3 --- S2 --- S1 --- CP --- B1 --- B2 --- B3

    style S3 fill:#ff6b6b,color:#fff
    style S2 fill:#ff6b6b,color:#fff
    style S1 fill:#ff6b6b,color:#fff
    style CP fill:#ffd93d,color:#000
    style B1 fill:#6bcb77,color:#fff
    style B2 fill:#6bcb77,color:#fff
    style B3 fill:#6bcb77,color:#fff
```

## How It Works

1. **Setup:** Bot places buy orders below current price, sell orders above
2. **Buy Fill:** When price drops, buy order fills → you accumulate position
3. **Sell Fill:** When price rises, sell order fills → you close position
4. **Repeat:** Grid rebuilds, capturing profits from oscillation

### Profit Calculation

**Per Round Trip:**
```
Profit = Spacing × Order Size - Fees
```

**Example:**
- Spacing: 0.5%
- Order Size: $100
- Fees: 0.04%

```
Profit = (0.5% × $100) - (0.04% × $100 × 2)
       = $0.50 - $0.08
       = $0.42 per round trip
```

## Configuration Parameters

### Levels per Side

Number of buy and sell orders on each side of current price.

| Setting | Orders | Capital Required | Use Case |
|---------|--------|------------------|----------|
| 1-3 | 2-6 total | Low | Conservative, small range |
| 4-7 | 8-14 total | Medium | Balanced approach |
| 8-20 | 16-40 total | High | Wide coverage, volatile markets |

### Spacing Percentage

Price distance between each grid level.

| Spacing | Profit per Fill | Fill Frequency | Best For |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| 0.1-0.3% | Low | High | Stable, tight range markets |
| 0.3-0.7% | Medium | Medium | Most conditions |
| 0.7-1.5% | High | Low | Volatile markets |
| 1.5%+ | Very High | Very Low | Extreme volatility |

### Order Size (USD)

How much capital per order.

**Considerations:**
- Larger orders = more profit per fill, but more capital tied up
- Smaller orders = more flexibility, less exposure per level
- Exchange minimum order sizes apply ($10 on Pacifica)

**Recommended:**
```
Order Size = Total Budget ÷ (Levels × 2) ÷ 2
```
This keeps 50% in reserve for position management.

### Boundary Percentage

Stop-loss trigger distance from starting price.

| Boundary | Protection | Grid Range | Trade-off |
|----------|------------|------------|-----------|
| 1-2% | Tight | Narrow | Quick stops, may miss recovery |
| 3-5% | Medium | Standard | Balanced protection |
| 5-10% | Wide | Large | More room, higher max loss |

When price moves beyond boundary:
- All orders cancelled
- Position closed (if possible)
- Bot stops with status `StoppedUpperBoundary` or `StoppedLowerBoundary`

## Preset Configurations

### Tight Grid (Ranging Markets)

For markets expected to stay in a narrow range.

```
Levels per Side: 8
Spacing: 0.25%
Order Size: $50
Boundary: 2%
─────────────────
Total Capital: $800
Grid Width: 4% (8 × 0.25% × 2 sides)
Expected Profit: $0.10 per round trip
```

**Best for:**
- Stable pairs (BTC, ETH)
- Low volatility periods
- Accumulating many small profits

### Wide Grid (Volatile Markets)

For markets with larger price swings.

```
Levels per Side: 5
Spacing: 1.0%
Order Size: $200
Boundary: 5%
─────────────────
Total Capital: $2,000
Grid Width: 10% (5 × 1.0% × 2 sides)
Expected Profit: $1.80 per round trip
```

**Best for:**
- Altcoins with higher volatility
- News-driven markets
- Larger swing opportunities

### Balanced Grid

Middle ground for most market conditions.

```
Levels per Side: 6
Spacing: 0.5%
Order Size: $100
Boundary: 3%
─────────────────
Total Capital: $1,200
Grid Width: 6%
Expected Profit: $0.42 per round trip
```

## Grid vs TWAP: When to Use Each

| Factor | Grid | TWAP |
|--------|------|------|
| **Market Condition** | Ranging/oscillating | Any direction |
| **Profit Source** | Price oscillation | Spread capture |
| **Position Risk** | Can accumulate | Managed by inventory |
| **Complexity** | More parameters | Simpler |
| **Best For** | Predictable ranges | Continuous market making |

**Choose Grid when:**
- Price has been oscillating in a range
- You have a view on support/resistance levels
- You want defined profit targets per fill

**Choose TWAP when:**
- You want continuous market making
- No strong view on price range
- You prefer automatic inventory management

## Risk Management

### Inventory Accumulation

Grid trading can accumulate significant positions:
- If price trends down: accumulates long
- If price trends up: accumulates short (if short-selling)

**Mitigation:**
- Use boundaries to limit exposure
- Monitor position size
- Consider bias settings if trending

### Boundary Hits

When price hits boundary, the grid stops. This protects against:
- Unlimited losses in trending markets
- Holding large positions in unfavorable direction

**After Boundary Stop:**
1. Review why boundary was hit
2. Assess if range assumption was wrong
3. Adjust grid parameters if restarting

### Capital Efficiency

Grid trading ties up capital across multiple levels:
```
Capital Locked = Order Size × Levels × 2
```

Plus margin for positions that fill.

**Optimize by:**
- Using only necessary levels
- Keeping reserve for position margin
- Monitoring utilization

## Monitoring Your Grid

### Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **Round Trips** | Completed buy→sell cycles |
| **Gross Profit** | Total profit from fills |
| **Fees Paid** | Exchange and Arbital fees |
| **Net Profit** | Gross - Fees |
| **Max Drawdown** | Largest unrealized loss |

### Warning Signs

- **No fills for extended time:** Grid might be too wide
- **All buys or all sells:** Price trending, approaching boundary
- **High fees vs profit:** Spacing might be too tight

## Tips for Success

1. **Match grid to market:**
   - Check historical volatility
   - Identify support/resistance levels
   - Set boundaries just beyond normal range

2. **Start conservative:**
   - Use smaller order sizes initially
   - Run for a day to observe behavior
   - Adjust based on actual fills

3. **Monitor regularly:**
   - Check position accumulation
   - Watch for boundary approach
   - Adjust if market conditions change

4. **Account for fees:**
   - Ensure spacing > total fees (both sides)
   - Factor Arbital + exchange fees
   - Wider spacing = more profitable fills

5. **Don't fight trends:**
   - Grid works best in ranging markets
   - If market starts trending, let boundary stop protect you
   - Re-evaluate before restarting

# Risk Management

Protect your capital with proper risk controls.

## Understanding Risks

### Market Risk
Price moves against your position before rebalancing.

**Mitigation:**
- Tighter rebalance thresholds
- Smaller position sizes
- Faster cooldown periods

### Liquidity Risk
Unable to exit positions at expected prices.

**Mitigation:**
- Trade liquid markets
- Avoid oversized positions
- Monitor order book depth

### Exchange Risk
Exchange downtime, bugs, or security issues.

**Mitigation:**
- Diversify across exchanges
- Don't over-allocate to one platform
- Monitor exchange status

### Smart Contract Risk
Vulnerabilities in exchange contracts.

**Mitigation:**
- Use established, audited exchanges
- Start with smaller amounts
- Stay informed about security updates

## Setting Up Alerts

### Position Alerts

Configure notifications for:
- Position size exceeds threshold
- Delta deviation beyond limit
- Unrealized P&L drops below threshold

### System Alerts

Get notified when:
- Bot stops unexpectedly
- API connection fails
- Order execution fails repeatedly

### Setting Alerts

1. Go to **Settings → Notifications**
2. Enable desired alert types
3. Configure thresholds
4. Add notification channels (Discord, Telegram, Email)

## Position Limits

### Per-Bot Limits

| Setting | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Max Position | Cap total exposure |
| Max Order Size | Limit single order impact |
| Daily Loss Limit | Auto-pause on losses |

### Account-Wide Limits

| Setting | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Total Exposure | Across all bots |
| Exchange Allocation | Max per exchange |
| Drawdown Limit | Account-level stop |

## Emergency Procedures

### Pause All Bots

One-click emergency stop:
1. Dashboard → **Emergency Stop**
2. All bots pause immediately
3. Positions remain open

### Close All Positions

Nuclear option:
1. **Emergency Stop** first
2. Click **Close All Positions**
3. Market orders close everything
4. Review slippage after

{% hint style="danger" %}
Closing all positions uses market orders and may incur significant slippage in volatile markets.
{% endhint %}

## Best Practices

1. **Start small** — Test with minimal capital first
2. **Diversify** — Don't put everything in one bot/exchange
3. **Monitor actively** — Especially in the first few days
4. **Set alerts** — Don't rely on manual checking
5. **Have a plan** — Know what you'll do in various scenarios

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Volume** | All-time trading volume across all bots |
| **Active Bots** | Number of currently running bots |
| **Total Fees & PnL** | Cumulative profit/loss and fees paid |

### Bot Filtering

Filter your bots by status:
- **All** — Show all bots
- **Active** — Currently running bots
- **Inactive** — Stopped or idle bots
- **Completed** — Finished bots

## Bot Detail View

Click any bot to see detailed analytics.

### Stats Cards

At the top, you'll see key metrics:

| Card | What It Shows | Color Coding |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| **Volume** | Total trading volume | — |
| **Fees/PnL** | Net profit or loss | Green = profit, Red = loss |
| **Progress** | Volume % of target | Progress bar |
| **Budget Used** | Fees % of budget | Progress bar |

### Balance Chart

Shows your account balance over time.

**How to read it:**
- **Upward trend** — Account growing (good)
- **Downward trend** — Account shrinking (investigate)
- **Flat line** — No change (bot may be idle)

**Timeframes:**
- 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d, 1w

Select shorter timeframes for recent activity, longer for trends.

### Volume Chart

Shows trading activity over time.

**How to read it:**
- **Tall bars** — High trading activity
- **Short bars** — Low activity
- **No bars** — Bot idle or no fills

**Interpreting patterns:**
- Consistent volume = bot running smoothly
- Sudden drops = possible issues
- Spikes = high market activity

## Events Table

Real-time log of bot activity.

### Event Types

| Event | Icon | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| **order_placed** | <i class="fa-paper-plane">:paper-plane:</i> | New order sent to exchange |
| **order_filled** | <i class="fa-circle-check">:circle-check:</i> | Order executed (trade complete) |
| **order_canceled** | <i class="fa-circle-xmark">:circle-xmark:</i> | Order removed from book |
| **error** | <i class="fa-circle-exclamation">:circle-exclamation:</i> | Something went wrong |
| **warning** | <i class="fa-triangle-exclamation">:triangle-exclamation:</i> | Non-critical issue |

### Event Details

Each event shows:
- **Timestamp** — When it happened
- **Type** — What kind of event
- **Side** — Buy (green) or Sell (red)
- **Details** — Price, size, or error message

### Using Events for Troubleshooting

**If you see many `error` events:**
1. Check the error message
2. Verify exchange connectivity
3. Check your balance
4. Review bot configuration

**If you see only `order_placed` but no `order_filled`:**
- Orders aren't filling
- Try more aggressive mode
- Check if spread is too wide

**If you see `order_canceled` frequently:**
- Normal behavior — bot refreshes orders
- High cancellation = active rebalancing

## Trades Table

History of executed trades.

### Trade Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Order ID** | Unique trade identifier |
| **Time** | When trade executed |
| **Asset** | Trading pair (ETH, BTC, etc.) |
| **Side** | Buy or Sell |
| **Size** | Trade amount |
| **Entry Price** | Price you entered at |
| **Exit Price** | Price you exited at (if closed) |
| **PnL** | Profit/loss on this trade |
| **Status** | Open or Closed |

### Reading Trade History

**Profitable trades:** PnL shows positive (green)
**Losing trades:** PnL shows negative (red)
**Open positions:** No exit price yet, PnL is unrealized

### Trade Statistics

Aggregated stats from all trades:
- Total buy volume
- Total sell volume
- Net PnL
- Number of round trips

## Positions Table

Current open positions.

### Position Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Symbol** | Market (ETH-PERP, etc.) |
| **Side** | Long or Short |
| **Size** | Position size |
| **Entry Price** | Average entry |
| **Mark Price** | Current market price |
| **Liq. Price** | Liquidation price |
| **Unrealized PnL** | Floating profit/loss |

### Understanding Liquidation Price

The **liquidation price** is where your position would be forcefully closed.

**For long positions:** Liq price is below entry
**For short positions:** Liq price is above entry

**Safety margin:** Keep price far from liquidation. If mark price approaches liq price, reduce position or add margin.

## Interpreting Performance

### Healthy Bot Signs

- <i class="fa-circle-check">:circle-check:</i> Steady balance growth
- <i class="fa-circle-check">:circle-check:</i> Regular order fills
- <i class="fa-circle-check">:circle-check:</i> Balanced buy/sell volume
- <i class="fa-circle-check">:circle-check:</i> Low error rate
- <i class="fa-circle-check">:circle-check:</i> Inventory staying near neutral

### Warning Signs

# Security Best Practices

Keep your trading operations secure with these guidelines.

## Non-Custodial Architecture

Arbital is designed with security first:

- **Your funds stay on the exchange** — Arbital never holds your assets
- **Credential binding, not key storage** — We link via wallet signatures
- **Trading permissions only** — No withdrawal access granted
- **Revocable access** — Unbind credentials anytime

## Credential Security

### How Credential Binding Works

Instead of storing your API keys, Arbital uses wallet-based authentication:

1. You connect your wallet to Arbital
2. Sign an authentication message
3. The signature links your wallet to trading permissions
4. Your private keys never leave your wallet

This approach:
- Eliminates API key storage risks
- Uses cryptographic proof of ownership
- Can be revoked by unbinding

### Best Practices

**DO:**
- Only bind credentials on the official Arbital website
- Verify you're on `arbital.xyz` before signing
- Review signature messages before approving
- Unbind credentials you're no longer using

**DON'T:**
- Share your wallet seed phrase with anyone
- Sign messages on unofficial sites
- Approve signatures you don't understand

## Wallet Security

### Hardware Wallets (Recommended)

Use hardware wallets for maximum security:
- **Ledger** — Supports EVM and Solana
- **Trezor** — Supports EVM

Benefits:
- Private keys never touch your computer
- Physical confirmation required for signatures
- Protected from malware

### Hot Wallet Best Practices

If using browser wallets (MetaMask, Phantom):

1. **Use a dedicated trading wallet**
   - Don't use your main savings wallet
   - Fund only what you need for trading

2. **Secure your seed phrase**
   - Write it down physically
   - Store in secure location (safe, bank)
   - Never store digitally

3. **Enable additional security**
   - Set a strong password
   - Enable auto-lock timeout
   - Consider hardware wallet integration

## Exchange Security

### Permission Principles

When Arbital binds credentials:
- **Read** — View balances and positions
- **Trade** — Place and cancel orders
- **No Withdraw** — Cannot move funds out

### What to Monitor

Regularly check on your exchange:
- Active API connections/sessions
- Recent trading activity
- Any unexpected positions

### Revoking Access

If you suspect unauthorized access:

1. **On the exchange:**
   - Revoke all API sessions
   - Change your password
   - Enable 2FA if not already

2. **On Arbital:**
   - Go to dashboard
   - Unbind all credentials
   - Re-bind only after securing exchange

## Operational Security

### Use Dedicated Browser Profile

Create a separate browser profile for trading:
- No random extensions
- Bookmarked official sites only
- Reduced phishing risk

### Verify URLs

Always check you're on the correct site:
- `arbital.xyz` — Official Arbital
- `hyperliquid.xyz` — Official Hyperliquid

Phishing sites often use:
- Misspellings (`arbita1.xyz`)
- Extra words (`arbital-app.xyz`)
- Different TLDs (`arbital.com`)

### Network Security

**DO:**
- Use secure, private networks
- Keep your operating system updated
- Use reputable VPN if on public networks

**DON'T:**
- Trade on public WiFi without VPN
- Ignore security warnings
- Click links in unsolicited messages

## Incident Response

### If You Suspect Compromise

**Immediate steps:**

1. **Stop all bots** from Arbital dashboard
2. **Unbind credentials** on Arbital
3. **Revoke API access** on exchange
4. **Close positions** manually if needed
5. **Change exchange password**
6. **Enable 2FA** if not enabled

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:
- Email: security@arbital.xyz
- Do not disclose publicly
- Include detailed reproduction steps
- We appreciate responsible disclosure

## Regular Security Checklist

### Weekly

- [ ] Review open positions match expected
- [ ] Check bot activity logs
- [ ] Verify no unexpected trades

### Monthly

- [ ] Review all bound credentials
- [ ] Unbind any unused credentials
- [ ] Check exchange API session list
- [ ] Update wallet software if needed

### Quarterly

- [ ] Rotate wallet if using hot wallet
- [ ] Review security of seed phrase storage
- [ ] Verify backup procedures
- [ ] Test credential unbinding process

## Common Scams to Avoid

### Phishing

- Fake websites asking for seed phrases
- Emails claiming urgent action needed
- Social media impersonators

**Protection:** Always type URLs directly, never click email links

### Fake Support

- DMs offering to "help"
- Requests for private keys or signatures
- "Sync wallet" popups

**Protection:** Official support never asks for private keys

### Malicious Approvals

- Token approval scams
- Unlimited spending allowances
- Fake airdrop claims

**Protection:** Review all transactions before signing

## Summary

| Layer | Best Practice |
|-------|---------------|
| **Wallet** | Hardware wallet or dedicated hot wallet |
| **Credentials** | Bind only on official site, unbind when not needed |
| **Exchange** | Monitor activity, enable 2FA |
| **Browser** | Dedicated profile, verify URLs |
| **Network** | Secure connections, avoid public WiFi |
| **Monitoring** | Regular reviews, quick incident response |

# Glossary

Quick reference for terms used throughout Arbital documentation.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** Use `Cmd/Ctrl + F` to search for specific terms.
{% endhint %}

## A

**Agent Binding** — Solana-specific process for linking wallet credentials to Arbital. Used on Pacifica exchange.

**Aggressive Mode** — Execution mode with 3-second refresh intervals. Fastest response to market changes, higher costs.

## B

**Balance Chart** — Dashboard visualization showing your account balance over time. Helps track bot performance.

**Bias** — Directional preference from -1 (full short) to +1 (full long). A bias of 0 is neutral/delta-neutral. Also called "Position Bias".

**Bot Lifecycle** — The states a bot transitions through: Idle → Pending → Running → Stopping → Stopped/Completed/Failed.

**Budget** — The expected fee allocation for your bot in USD. Determines how much you're willing to spend on trading fees.

**Boundary** — In grid trading, the price distance from start that triggers a stop-loss.

**Bot** — Automated trading program that executes your strategy on an exchange.

## C

**Collateral** — Assets deposited as margin for trading positions.

**Credential Binding** — Process of securely linking exchange API access to your wallet via message signature. No private keys are stored.

## D

**Delta** — Measure of position's directional exposure to price changes.

**Delta-Neutral** — Strategy with zero net directional exposure. Profits from fees and spreads rather than price direction.

## E

**Execution Mode** — How frequently the bot refreshes orders: Aggressive (3s), Normal (5s), or Passive (7s).

**Extended** — Arbital's internal name for the Hyperliquid exchange integration.

**EIP-712** — Ethereum signing standard for typed structured data. Used for secure wallet authentication without transactions.

## F

**Funding Rate** — Periodic payment between long and short position holders on perpetual futures.

## G

**Grid Market Maker** — Strategy that places orders at fixed price intervals to profit from oscillation.

**Grid Spacing** — Percentage distance between price levels in a grid strategy.

## I

**Inventory** — Your current position exposure, measured in USD.

**Inventory Skew Factor** — How aggressively the bot rebalances when inventory builds up. 0% = no adjustment, 100% = maximum adjustment.

## L

**Leverage** — Trading with borrowed capital to amplify position size.

**Liquidation** — Forced closure of position when margin is insufficient.

## M

**Maker** — Trader who adds liquidity by placing limit orders.

**Market Making** — Providing liquidity by quoting both buy and sell prices, profiting from the spread.

**Max Inventory** — Hard limit on directional position exposure in USD. When reached, bot only places orders to reduce position.

**Mode** — See "Execution Mode".

## N

**Non-Custodial** — Security model where Arbital never holds your funds or private keys. Your assets remain in your exchange account at all times.

**Normal Mode** — Execution mode with 5-second refresh intervals. Balanced approach for most conditions.

**Notional** — The total USD value to trade in a TWAP strategy, split between buy and sell orders based on bias.

## O

**Order Book** — List of buy and sell orders at various prices on an exchange.

## P

**Pacifica** — Supported exchange on Solana requiring referral approval and agent binding.

**Passive Mode** — Execution mode with 7-second refresh intervals. Slower response, lower costs.

**Pending** — Bot state when queued and connecting to exchange before running.

**Perpetual Futures (Perps)** — Futures contracts with no expiration date.

**Points** — Exchange reward tokens earned through trading activity. Many exchanges offer points programs to incentivize volume.

**Position** — Your current holding in a market (long or short).

**Position Bias** — See "Bias".

## R

**Reduce-Only** — Mode where bot only places orders to reduce existing positions, not increase them.

**Refresh Interval** — How often the bot re-evaluates and adjusts orders based on execution mode.

**Round Trip** — In grid trading, a completed buy→sell or sell→buy cycle that captures profit.

## S

**Skew Factor** — See "Inventory Skew Factor".

**Slippage** — Difference between expected and actual execution price.

**Strategy** — The trading approach: TWAP Market Maker or Grid Market Maker.

## T

**Taker** — Trader who removes liquidity by taking existing orders.

- **Extended (Hyperliquid)** — EVM wallet, $20 minimum

Coming soon: Aster, Hibachi, Based App

### How much capital do I need?

- **Minimum:** $20 for Pacifica/Extended
- **Recommended:** $500+ for meaningful returns
- **Start small:** Test with smaller amounts before scaling up

---

## Strategies

### What's the difference between TWAP and Grid?

**TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price):**
- Spreads orders over time
- Continuous market making
- Automatic inventory management
- Best for: General market making, any market condition

**Grid:**
- Places orders at fixed price intervals
- Profits from price oscillation
- Defined profit per fill
- Best for: Ranging markets, expected price bounds

### What does bias mean?

Bias controls the **timing priority** of your buys and sells:
- **-1 (Short):** Prioritizes selling early, profits from price drops
- **0 (Neutral):** 50/50 buy/sell, delta-neutral
- **+1 (Long):** Prioritizes buying early, profits from price rises

Bias only affects **when** buys and sells happen — not **whether** they happen. The bot always places both buy and sell orders, and total volume converges over the full run. Higher bias levels increase margin requirements by up to 20%.

Most users start with **neutral (0)** to minimize directional risk.

### Which execution mode should I use?

| Mode | Refresh | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Aggressive** | 3 seconds | Volatile markets, maximum volume |
| **Normal** | 5 seconds | Most situations, balanced approach |
| **Passive** | 7 seconds | Stable markets, cost savings |

- **Aggressive** maximizes volume but is more prone to slippage and faster inventory accumulation in volatile conditions
- **Normal** provides the best balance between volume generation and execution quality
- **Passive** prioritizes execution quality and fee efficiency over speed

When in doubt, start with **Normal** — it suits most market conditions and lets you evaluate performance before adjusting.

## Bot Management

### Why is my bot stuck in "pending"?

Common causes:
1. Exchange API is slow or down
2. Network congestion
3. Credential binding issue

**Solution:** Wait 2-3 minutes. If still pending, stop the bot and try starting again.

### Why did my bot fail?

Check the error message. Common causes:
- Insufficient balance on exchange
- Credential binding expired
- Position limits exceeded
- Exchange maintenance

### Can I edit a running bot?

No. You must stop the bot first, then edit, then restart.

Editable states: Idle, Stopped, Failed

### Can I run multiple bots?

Yes. You can run multiple bots on:
- Different exchanges simultaneously
- Different markets on the same exchange
- Same market with different strategies (not recommended)

---

## Inventory & Risk

### What is inventory management?

Your "inventory" is your current position exposure in USD. Inventory management automatically:
- Tracks your position size
- Skews orders to reduce exposure
- Stops adding to positions at max limits

### What happens when I hit max inventory?

The bot enters **reduce-only mode**:
- If max long: only places sell orders
- If max short: only places buy orders
- Normal trading resumes when inventory decreases

### Why is my inventory building up?

Possible causes:
- Price trending in one direction
- Skew factor too low
- Bias setting creating directional exposure

**Solutions:**
- Increase inventory skew factor
- Use more neutral bias
- Reduce max inventory limit

---

## Costs & Returns

### What are the fees?

| Exchange | Exchange Fee | Arbital Fee | Total |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Pacifica | 0.015-0.025% | 0.02% | 0.035-0.045% |
| Extended | 0.01-0.02% | 0.02% | 0.03-0.04% |

**Arbital charges a builder fee of 2 bps (0.02%) on executed volume.** Combined with typical exchange fees:

> **Example:** For every **$1M in volume**, you'll pay approximately **~$350 in total fees** (1.5 bps average exchange fee + 2.0 bps Arbital fee = 3.5 bps total).

### What returns can I expect?

Returns depend on:
- Market volatility
- Strategy configuration
- Exchange incentive programs
- Your execution mode

**Important:** Past performance doesn't guarantee future results. Market making has risks.

### Can I lose money?

Yes. Risks include:
- Adverse price movements (especially with biased strategies)
- Inventory accumulation during trends
- Exchange downtime or failures
- Configuration errors

Start small and understand your strategy before scaling.

---

## Security

### Are my credentials safe?

Yes. Arbital uses credential binding:
- You sign a message with your wallet
- Your private keys never leave your wallet
- No API secrets are stored
- Credentials can be revoked anytime

### Can Arbital withdraw my funds?

No. Credential binding only grants trading permissions. Withdrawals are never possible through Arbital.

### What if my wallet is compromised?

1. Unbind credentials on Arbital immediately
2. Revoke API sessions on the exchange
3. Secure your wallet
4. Check for unauthorized trades

---

## Technical

### Why aren't my orders filling?

Possible causes:
- Market too illiquid
- Spread too wide compared to market
- Price moving faster than your refresh rate

**Solutions:**
- Try a more liquid market (BTC, ETH)
- Use more aggressive execution mode
- Reduce order size

### How do I see my trade history?

From the dashboard:
1. Click on your bot
2. Go to **Reports** tab
3. View trades, volume, and PnL

### Can I use Arbital programmatically?

Yes. See the [API Reference](reference/api.md) for endpoints to create, manage, and monitor bots.

# Security & Transparency

Arbital is committed to security transparency. This page documents our security architecture, audit status, and incident response procedures.

---

## Security Architecture

### Non-Custodial Design

Arbital operates on a **fully non-custodial model**:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph User["Your Control"]
        W[Wallet]
        K[Private Keys]
    end

    subgraph Arbital["Arbital Platform"]
        A[Authentication]
        B[Bot Orchestration]
    end

    subgraph Exchange["Exchange"]
        E[Your Funds]
        T[Trading API]
    end

    W -->|Signature Only| A
    K -.->|Never Leaves| W
    B -->|Trade Commands| T
    E -.->|Stays On| Exchange
```

| Security Property | Implementation |
|-------------------|----------------|
| **No key storage** | Private keys never leave your wallet |
| **No fund custody** | Assets remain on the exchange |
| **Trading only** | No withdrawal permissions granted |
| **Revocable access** | Unbind credentials anytime |

### Authentication Security

- **EIP-712 Typed Data Signing** — Structured, readable signatures for EVM wallets
- **Solana Message Signing** — Standard Solana signature flow
- **Timestamp Binding** — Signatures include timestamps to prevent replay attacks
- **Session Management** — Secure, encrypted session tokens

### Infrastructure Security

| Layer | Security Measures |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Frontend** | HTTPS only, CSP headers, XSS protection |
| **Backend** | Rate limiting, input validation, encrypted at rest |
| **Bot Engine** | Isolated containers, no persistent credentials |
| **Database** | Encrypted, access-controlled, regular backups |

---

## Audit Status

### Smart Contract Audits

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Status: Pending**

Arbital does not deploy its own smart contracts. We integrate with third-party exchanges (Pacifica, Hyperliquid) that have their own audit histories.

When Arbital deploys on-chain components, this section will be updated with audit reports.
{% endhint %}

### Exchange Audit References

| Exchange | Audit Status | Reference |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Pacifica** | Audited | See Pacifica documentation |

# Risk Disclosure

> **Important:** Please read this entire document carefully before using Arbital. Trading perpetual futures and market-making involves substantial risk of loss.

## General Risk Warning

**Trading perpetual futures and cryptocurrency derivatives involves significant risk and is not suitable for all users.** You should carefully consider whether trading is appropriate for you in light of your experience, objectives, financial resources, and other relevant circumstances.

Arbital is a software platform that facilitates automated trading. **We do not provide financial advice, and nothing on this platform should be construed as such.**

---

## Market Risks

### Volatility Risk
Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. Prices can move significantly in short periods, which may result in:
- Rapid depletion of your trading capital
- Liquidation of positions
- Losses exceeding your initial expectations

### Liquidity Risk
- Markets may lack sufficient liquidity to execute orders at expected prices
- Wide spreads during volatile periods can impact bot performance
- Low liquidity can lead to slippage and unexpected losses

### Funding Rate Risk
- Perpetual futures have funding rates that can be positive or negative
- Adverse funding rates can erode profits over time
- Funding rate volatility may impact delta-neutral strategy returns

---

## Smart Contract & Technical Risks

### Exchange Smart Contract Risk
- Arbital connects to third-party decentralized exchanges (Pacifica, Hyperliquid, etc.)
- These exchanges operate on smart contracts that may contain bugs or vulnerabilities
- Smart contract failures could result in loss of funds
- Arbital has no control over the security of connected exchanges

### Protocol Risk
- DeFi protocols may be subject to exploits, hacks, or economic attacks
- Oracle failures or manipulation can cause unexpected liquidations
